#WebCache

This is a chrome browser extension that allows the user to view a cached version of the current web page.
This is useful if the website:

1. DDOS attacked (Too much Reddit traffic)
1. Taken down for maintenance
1. No longer exists
1. Has older versions with different content

Install this extension [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/webcache/cmmlgikpahieigpcclckfmhnchdlfnjd)

#Contributing

I explicitly welcome contributions from people who have never contributed to open-source before: we were all beginners once!
I can help build on a partially working pull request with the aim of getting it merged.
I am also actively seeking to diversify our contributors and especially welcome contributions from women from all backgrounds and people of color. <sup>[1](#References)</sup>
