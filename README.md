#Contributing

I explicitly welcome contributions from people who have never contributed to open-source before: we were all beginners once! I can help build on a partially working pull request with the aim of getting it merged. I am also actively seeking to diversify our contributors and especially welcome contributions from women from all backgrounds and people of color. <sup>[1](#References)</sup>

If you're interested in contributing, fork this repo and create a pull request. Please follow the [JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).

Thank you to Jason Rainbows for making all of the images
